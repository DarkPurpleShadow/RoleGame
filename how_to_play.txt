Welcome to RoleGame

This game player is for defining and playing RPG games, however it's still in its early stage, so no stories can be defined yet (and no "end of game, sorry").
Each world is defined in an xml File which you must load to be able to play. 
You can play this game in console mode or in gui mode, but the first one is recommended for now.

Console Mode:
Execute Game object.
To load a game, you must type "load $GAME_PATH", where $GAME_PATH is the absolute or relative path to the file you want to load.
Once the game is loaded, you can look arround by typing "look", and to look at a particular element, just type "look $ELEMENT".
To move from one place to another type "go $PLACE_TO_GO".
To fight some enemy, type "fight $NAME_OF_THE_ENEMY".
There is also the search command, but for now it just informs you that you just used it.

Finally, when you get bored of this crap, you can just type "exit", to nicely exit this *ehem* game.

Have fun!
